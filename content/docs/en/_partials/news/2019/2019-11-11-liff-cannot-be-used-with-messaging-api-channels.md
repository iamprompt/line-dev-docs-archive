title: Do not add LIFF apps to the Messaging API channel
type: note
---
At this time, users can add LIFF apps to the Messaging API channel. However, we strongly advise against it due to the following restrictions:

- The bot link feature can't be used.
- LIFF feature expansion may not be supported.
- The LIFF app may not be usable in the future.

LIFF apps added to the LINE Login channel have no restrictions and can use all LIFF v2 functions.

### Transition to the LINE Login channel

To continue using the LIFF app added to the Messaging API channel, re-add the LIFF app to the LINE Login channel. Once re-added, LINE Developers Console will issue a new LIFF app ID. As a result, please take note of the following:

- If you're using LIFF v2, change the LIFF app ID specified in `liff.init()`.
- The LIFF URL used to launch LIFF (e.g.: line://app/1234567890-AbcdEfgh) will change.
